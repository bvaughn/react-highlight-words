React component to highlight words within a larger body of text.

Check out a demo [here](https://bvaughn.github.io/react-highlight-words).

## Usage

To use it, just provide it with an array of search terms and a body of text to highlight:

```html
<Highlighter
  highlightClassName='YourHighlightClass'
  searchWords={['and', 'or', 'the']}
  textToHighlight="The dog is chasing the cat. Or perhaps they're just playing?"
/>
```

And the `Highlighter` will mark all occurrences of search terms within the text:
